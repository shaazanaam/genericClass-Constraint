 This statement refers to the rules around generic 
type constraints in object-oriented programming, 
particularly in languages like C#. Let’s break it down:

Generic Classes and Constraints
When you define a generic class, 
you can specify constraints on the types 
that can be used as type parameters.
These constraints ensure that the type 
parameters meet certain criteria, such as
implementing a specific interface or having
a parameterless constructor.

Open Constructed Types
An open constructed type is a 
generic type that has some of its type
parameters specified and some left open. 
For example, List<T> is an open constructed type 
because T is not specified.

Inheritance and Constraints
When a generic class inherits from another generic class,
it must respect the constraints of the base class. 
Specifically, the constraints on the derived class 
must be a superset of, or imply, the constraints on the base class.
This ensures that the derived class can fulfill 
all the requirements of the base class.

Example
Consider the following example:

C#

public class BaseClass<T> where T : IComparable<T>
{
    // Base class implementation
}

public class DerivedClass<T> : BaseClass<T> where T : 
IComparable<T>, new()
{
    // Derived class implementation
}

Explanation
BaseClass<T>: This class has a constraint that T must implement
IComparable<T>.
DerivedClass<T>: This class inherits from BaseClass<T>
and adds an additional constraint that T must have 
a parameterless constructor (new()).
In this case, the constraints on DerivedClass<T> 
are a superset of the constraints on BaseClass<T>. 
This means that any type T that satisfies the
constraints of DerivedClass<T> will also satisfy
the constraints of BaseClass<T>.
